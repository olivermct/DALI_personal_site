		<p> About Me </p>
	</div>

	<div class="contents">
		<p>I was born in Pittsburgh PA but have spent most of my life growing up in Melbourne FL. I am currently a pre-med student majoring in Computer Science, and I just discovered a love for developing things that look good and that people love to use. I would love the opportunity to grow and learn with the DALI lab!</p>

		<p><b>Things I love</b>: Hayao Miyazaki, mountains, Kishi Bashi, viola, Fulham Football Club, Cloud9 </p>
		<p><b>Life Goals</b>: Own at least two dogs and one cat, hike a mountain with a big dog, make a cat love me for who I am and not the food I give them</p>
		<p><b>Unpopular Opinions</b>: Violas are better versions of violins, corgis are overrated and pitbulls are misunderstood</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Dogs!</h1>

		<p> Look at these cuties! I absolutely love dogs and one of my favorite things to do is go to animal shelters and play with the dogs. If you're thinking about getting a dog, adopt from a shelter! They need all the love they can get and they are just the sweetest. </p>
